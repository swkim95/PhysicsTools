# NanoAODTools
A simple set of python tools to post-process NanoAODs to: 
* skim events 
* add variables
* produce plots
* perform simple analyses (but beware that performance may be unsatisfactory beacuse of the inherently sequential design model).

It can be used directly from a CMSSW environment, or checked out as a standalone package.

Originally imported to CMSSW from [cms-nanoAOD/nanoAOD-tools](https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/nanoAOD-tools) (post-processor functionality only).

## Instruction for Run2 UL NanoAOD skimming + running CRAB

### Simple recipe (Run on LXPLUS8)
    cmsrel CMSSW_13_3_0
    cd CMSSW_13_3_0/src
    cmsenv
    git cms-init
    git clone <this repo>
    scram b -j 4
    cd PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/crab_Run2_UL_Skim
    python3 generate_scripts.py 2018_list.txt ./2018
    cd 2018/WJetsToLNu
    # Change the output site and directory in crab_cfg_WJetsToLNu.py
    crab submit -c crab_cfg_WJetsToLNu.py 

### Explanation for each items

All scripts prepared in direcotry `crab_Run2_UL_Skim`, and all CRAB related jobs are done under this directory.

* Directories `2016_preVFP, 2016_postVFP, 2017, 2018` : Directories of each process, and thier CRAB scripts will be stored under this directories.

* Process list `2016preVFP_list.txt, 2016postVFP_list.txt, 2017_list.txt, 2018_list.txt` : Process name and its DAS path for each subera written in each file.

* Python script `generate_scripts.py` : Generates directorie and CRAB scripts for the processes defined in the process list. Run by `python3 generate_scripts.py <Process list> <output subera directory>`. For example, `python3 generate_scripts.py 2018_list.txt 2018/` will generate `2018/<process name>` directories, and CRAB scripts under each of them.

* Skimming list `Run2_UL_SkimList_Data.txt, Run2_UL_SkimList_MC.txt` : Branch skimming defined in these files.

### How to add process and run CRAB

1. Add `<process name>,<DAS path>` to corresponding subera's process list text file.
    - Ex) Add line `WZ,/WZ_TuneCP5_13TeV-pythia8/RunIISummer20UL17NanoAODv9-20UL17JMENano_106X_mc2017_realistic_v9-v1/NANOAODSIM` in `2017_list.txt`

2. Fix `generate_scripts.py` if required. The CRAB output site and directory should be changed. Look for `script_content`and fix the `config.Data.outLFNDirBase` and `config.Site.storageSite`. Postprocessor setting is defined in `script_content_2`.

3. Generate CRAB scripts using `generate_scripts.py`
    - Ex) `python3 generate_scripts.py 2017_list.txt ./2017`

4. Submit CRAB job under `<subera>/<process name>` directory
    - Ex) `cd 2017/WZ; crab submit -c crab_cfg_WZ.py;`

### Explanation of each CRAB script

There are 4 scripts produced under `<subera>/<process name>` directory
Unlike many other CMSSW modules, the NanoAOD post processor does not use EDProducer/EDAnalyzer etc. So it cannot be run with cmsRun, but should be ran with python.
To do so, we submit fake PSet to CRAB which does nothing, and use `crab_script.sh` to run the actual post processing script (`crab_script.py`) using python.

* `PSet.py` : Fake PSet for CRAB submission. No need to change this file.

* `crab_scrtip.sh` : The shell script which CRAB job executes. Nothing done in this script, it just runs the `crab_script.py` using python, not cmsRun. No need to change this file.

* `crab_cfg_<process name>.py` : CRAB configuration file. Input process, output file site and directory, GoldenJson for Run/Lumi skimming are defined here.

* `crab_script.py` : This script is where actual post processor is defined. Currently only branch skimming, and Run/Lumi skimming for Data is applied. One can modify the post processor to add cut, or some other features defined in post processor class.


## Usage in CMSSW
No specific setup is needed.

It is recommended to add external modules (eg correction modules) in separate packages.

## Standalone usage (without CMSSW): checkout instructions

You need to setup python 3 and a recent ROOT version first.

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-sw/cmssw/master/PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/standalone/checkoutStandalone.sh
    bash checkoutStandalone.sh -d MyProject 
    cd MyProject
    source PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/standalone/env_standalone.sh

Repeat only the last command at the beginning of every session.

It is recommended to add analysis code, correction modules etc. in a separate package and repository rather than in a CMSSW fork.

Please note that some limitations apply:
* Bindings to C++ code are up to the user.
* Adding packed variables is not supported, as this requires binding to the corresponding code.
Using from a CMSSW environment is thus recommended.

## General instructions to run the post-processing step
The post-processor can be run in two different ways:
* In a normal python script.
* From the command line, using the script under `scripts/nano_postproc.py` (more details [below](#command-line-invocation)).

## How to write and run modules

It is possible to define modules that will be run on each entry passing the event selection, and can be used to calculate new variables that will be included in the output tree (both in friend and full mode) or to apply event filter decisions.

A first, very simple example is available in `test/exampleAnalysis.py`. It can be executed directly, and implements a module to fill a plot.

An example of an module coded to be imported in scripts or called with the command-line interface is available in `python/postprocessing/examples/exampleModule.py`. This module adds one new variable, which can be stored in skimmed NanoAOD and also used in the subsequent Modules in the same job. The example `test/example_postproc.py` shows how to import and use it in a script while skimming events.

Let us now examine the structure of a module class. 
* All modules must inherit from `PhysicsTools.NanoAODTools.postprocessing.framework.eventloop.Module`.
* the `__init__` constructor function should be used to set the module options.
* the `beginFile` function should create the branches that you want to add to the output file, calling the `branch(branchname, typecode, lenVar)` method of `wrappedOutputTree`. `typecode` should be the ROOT TBranch type ("F" for float, "I" for int etc.). `lenVar` should be the name of the variable holding the length of array branches (for instance, `branch("Electron_myNewVar","F","nElectron")`). If the `lenVar` branch does not exist already - it can happen if you create a new collection - it will be automatically created.
* the `analyze` function is called on each event. It should return `True` if the event is to be retained, `False` if it should be dropped.

The event interface, defined in `PhysicsTools.NanoAODTools.postprocessing.framework.datamodule`, allows to dynamically construct views of objects organized in collections, based on the branch names, for instance:

    electrons = Collection(event, "Electron")
    if len(electrons)>1: print electrons[0].someVar+electrons[1].someVar
    electrons_highpt = filter(lambda x: x.pt>50, electrons)

and this will access the elements of the `Electron_someVar`, `Electron_pt` branch arrays. Event variables can be accessed simply by `event.someVar`, for instance `event.rho`.

The output branches should be filled calling the `fillBranch(branchname, value)` method of `wrappedOutputTree`. `value` should be the desired value for single-value branches, an iterable with the correct length for array branches. It is not necessary to fill the `lenVar` branch explicitly, as this is done automatically using the length of the passed iterable.



### Command-line invocation
The basic syntax of the command line invocation is the following:

    nano_postproc.py /path/to/output_directory /path/to/input_tree.root

(in standalone mode, should be invoked as `./scripts/nano_postproc.py`).

Here is a summary of its features:
* the `-s`,`--postfix` option is used to specify the suffix that will be appended to the input file name to obtain the output file name. It defaults to *_Friend* in friend mode, *_Skim* in full mode.
* the `-c`,`--cut` option is used to pass a string expression (using the same syntax as in TTree::Draw) that will be used to select events. It cannot be used in friend mode.
* the `-J`,`--json` option is used to pass the name of a JSON file that will be used to select events. It cannot be used in friend mode.
* if run with the `--full` option (default), the output will be a full nanoAOD file. If run with the `--friend` option, instead, the output will be a friend tree that can be attached to the input tree. In the latter case, it is not possible to apply any kind of event selection, as the number of entries in the parent and friend tree must be the same.
* the `-b`,`--branch-selection` option is used to pass the name of a file containing directives to keep or drop branches from the output tree. The file should contain one directive among `keep`/`drop` (wildcards allowed as in TTree::SetBranchStatus) or `keepmatch`/`dropmatch` (python regexp matching the branch name) per line. More details are provided in the section [Keep/drop branches](#keepdrop-branches) below.
  * `--bi` and `--bo` allows to specify the keep/drop file separately for input and output trees.  
* the `--justcount` option will cause the script to printout the number of selected events, without actually writing the output file.

Please run with `--help` for a complete list of options.

Let's take the already mentioned [exampleModule.py](python/postprocessing/examples/exampleModule.py). It contains a simple constructor:
```
   exampleModuleConstr = lambda : exampleProducer(jetSelection= lambda j : j.pt > 30)
```
whih can be imported using the following syntax:

```
nano_postproc.py outDir /eos/cms/store/user/andrey/f.root -I PhysicsTools.NanoAODTools.postprocessing.examples.exampleModule exampleModuleConstr
```

### Keep/drop branches
See the effect of keep/drop instructions by creating a `keep_and_drop.txt` file:

```
drop *
keep Muon*
keep Electron*
keep Jet*
```
and specify it with thne --bi option:
```
python scripts/nano_postproc.py outDir /eos/cms/store/user/andrey/f.root -I PhysicsTools.NanoAODTools.postprocessing.examples.exampleModule exampleModuleConstr -s _exaModu_keepdrop --bi keep_and_drop_input.txt 
```
comparing to the previous command (without `--bi`), the output branch created by _exampleModuleConstr_ is the same, but with --bi  all other branche are dropped when creating output tree. It also runs faster.
Option --bo can be used to further fliter output branches.  

The keep and drop directive also accept python lists __when called from a python script__, e.g:
```
outputbranchsel=["drop *", "keep EventMass"]
```

### Calling C++ helpers 
Now, let's have a look at another example, `python/postprocessing/examples/mhtjuProducerCpp.py` ([link](python/postprocessing/examples/mhtjuProducerCpp.py)). Similarly, it should be imported using the following syntax:

```
nano_postproc.py outDir /eos/cms/store/user/andrey/f.root -I PhysicsTools.NanoAODTools.postprocessing.examples.mhtjuProducerCpp mhtju
```
This module has the same structure of its producer as `exampleProducer`, but in addition it utilizes a C++ code to calculate the mht variable, `test/examples/mhtjuProducerCppWorker.cc`. This code is loaded in the `__init__` method of the producer.
